                                And the students.Throughout this year, we had to use the laboratory of USTHB due to our unfinished laboratory. However, insha'Allah, we will start working in our own lab starting from this September.</p>

We chose this name to represent what we went through this year. We are grateful for both the good and the bad. We also hope that the situation of our school continues to improve to meet international standards.</p>

                                the administration will take the necessary steps to organize the official creation of the scientific clubs,

                            My experience in this school has been incredibly  enriching and transformative.. It's a field that constantly challenges me to think critically and creatively, as it combines elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering 
                            .Moreover, the collaborative atmosphere among students fosters a dynamic learning environment. 
                            You'll find yourself exchanging ideas with peers from diverse backgrounds, contributing to  projects, and building lasting connections .
                            to the future students , my advice is to embrace every challenge with enthusiasm and curiosity. 
                            Dedicate yourself fully to your studies and take advantage of the resources available. Stay organized, manage your time effectively, 
                            and don't hesitate to seek help from professors and peers when needed. 
                            Collaborate with your classmates, as teamwork is essential in this field. 
                            Most importantly, maintain a passion for learning and innovation,be creative and dont forget that Creativity does not stem from having resources; rather, 
                            it emerges from minds. A shortage of resources is not an excuse for lack of innovation and invention. 
                            If the mind is enlightened, its ideas can solve all challenges, regardless of resource limitations. 
                            Indeed, these devices and capabilities originate from the minds of individuals whose ideas spawned them. 
                            Therefore, create the idea and invent the means, as this will drive you to achieve excellence and make the most of your</q>

                    <q>I've learned a lot from this school, both the good and the bad. I have learned to be independent in my studies and to take the responsibilities I choose to take.
                         I also had the chance to meet different kinds of people from all around Algeria.
                          Personally, I would recommend this school to other students as a college after the baccalaureate.
                         And my only advice is to be patient with the school's development.

                    <q>My first-year experience at the National School of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology was fairly acceptable for the first Promo, despite the pedagogical and service shortcomings, the year passed under good conditions in terms of education and formation, and I have a view that the school will have a wonderful future, especially since it is a hub for a very advanced scientific specialty.</q>

                    <q>I think this year is going to be the hardest year in my academic journey. 
                        What’s important is that I passed my year and learned the basics needed for my second year, Alhamdulillah.
                         My advice to you is to focus on your studies and not let yourself get distracted by hangouts, games, or even school politics. 
                        Our parents sent us to this place, away from our comfort zones, to learn, and they trust us with that. Don’t disappoint them.</q>

                    <q>It's a great experience so far, we've learned a lot of new and interesting things in Maths, Physics, Chemistry and more. I've met a bunch of enthusiastic friends. I've also met some cool teachers. 
                        Our Scientific clubs had a great start and they have organized awesome events.
                        We faced some administrative problems since it's the first year for our school, but it's getting better inchAllah.
                        When being in the ENSNN, you need to be serious, hard working and consistent. That's my advice for future students. Also you need to depend on yourself, because unfortunately you may have an "unprofessional" teacher or a "not-good" one. That's the most important lesson I've learned this year..</q>

                        <p class="section-subtitle">Nanoscience and nanotechnologies are widely seen as having huge potential to bring benefits to many areas of research and application, 
                            and are attracting rapidly increasing investments from Governments and from businesses in many parts of the world. At the same time,
                             it is recognised that their application may raise new challenges in the safety, regulatory or ethical domains that will require societal debate.
                            There are many ways to see how the next technological revolution will be related to nanotechnology. Here are some websites to explore for yourself.</p>
